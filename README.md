This is a simple Python-based security tool that checks whether a password is strong or weak using common cybersecurity standards. The program analyzes the password and verifies if it meets important security requirements such as minimum length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Regular expressions are used to detect different character types, making the validation process efficient and practical.

This project helps demonstrate basic authentication security concepts used in real-world systems.
